									<h2>Independent Electron Model</h2>
									<body>
										<div class="formula">
											\begin{equation}\mathcal{H}\Phi_n(\vec{r}_1,...,\vec{r}_N) = E_n\Phi_n(\vec{r}_1,...,\vec{r}_N)\qquad\qquad(7.25)\end{equation}
											\begin{equation}\mathcal{H} = \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\frac{-\hbar^2\nabla_i^2}{2m_e}-\sum_I\frac{e^2Z}{|\vec{r}_i-\vec{R}_I|}\right)+\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i\neq j}^N\frac{e^2}{|\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j|}\qquad\qquad(7.26)\end{equation}
										
											It is frequently a good approximation to replace <span>`\mathcal{H}`</span> by an effective independent-particle Hamiltonian
											\begin{equation}\mathcal{H} = \sum_{i=1}^N H_i= \sum_{i=1}^N\left(\frac{-\hbar^2\nabla_i^2}{2m_e} + v_{eff}(\vec{r}_i)\right)\qquad\qquad(7.27)\end{equation}
										
											<span>`v_{eff}`</span> is some sort of effective potential which includes the interaction of an electron with the nuclei and represents in some average way the interaction of an electron with all other electrons.

											The most naive case is one where <span>`v_{eff}=0`</span>.  This leaves us with the so-called free-electron-gas model. In this model the single-particle states are plane waves, which can be labeled by a wave vector,
											\begin{equation}\langle \vec{v}|\vec{k}\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{L^3}}exp(i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}) \qquad\qquad(7.28)\end{equation}
											
											These plane waves have eigenenergy and are eigenstates of the velocity operator with eigenvalue <span>`\hbar\vec{k}/m_e`</span>.
											\begin{equation} \epsilon_{\vec{k}} =\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m_e} \qquad\qquad(7.29)\end{equation}
											\begin{equation} \vec{V} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = \frac{i}{\hbar}[H,\vec{r}] = \frac{i}{2m_e\hbar}[\vec{p}\cdot\vec{p},\vec{r}] = \frac{i}{m_e\hbar}\vec{p}(-i\hbar) = \frac{\vec{p}}{m_e} = \frac{-i\hbar\nabla}{m_e} \qquad\qquad(7.30)\end{equation}
											
											The next-simplest model, sometimes called the independent-particle model, uses
											\begin{equation} v_{eff} = V(\vec{r}) \qquad\qquad(7.31)\end{equation}

											where V is a periodic potential with the symmetries of the crystalline lattice:
											\begin{equation} v_{eff} = V(\vec{r}) \qquad\qquad(7.32)\end{equation}
											where <span>`\vec{R}_j`</span> is a lattice vector of the crystal.

									<h2>Bloch's Theorem</h2>
									<body>
										<div class="formula">
											
											Now <span>`V(\vec{r})`</span> (and hence H ) has the translation symmetry of the lattice:
											\begin{equation} V(\vec{r}+\vec{a}_j) = V(\vec{r})\qquad\qquad(7.35)\end{equation}
										
											Let us start with the simplest possible case, <span>`V(\vec{r})=constant`</span>. In this case
											\begin{equation} [H,T_{\vec{l}}] = 0 \qquad\qquad(7.37)\end{equation}
											\begin{equation} T_{\vec{l}} = e^{i\vec{p}\cdot\vec{l}/\hbar} \qquad\qquad(7.38)\end{equation}
											When <span>`V(\vec{r})`</span> is not a constant, we have
											\begin{equation} [H,T_{\vec{a}_j}] = 0 \qquad\qquad(7.37)\end{equation}
											That is, we can choose our energy eigenstates <span>`\psi`</span> to be eigenstates of <span>`\{T_j\}`</span>
											\begin{equation} T_j\psi = \lambda_j\psi \qquad\qquad(7.45)\end{equation}
											If we now invoke periodic boundary conditions
											\begin{equation} \psi(\vec{r}+M\vec{a}_j) = \psi(\vec{r}) \qquad\qquad(7.46)\end{equation}
											where M is a large integer, then we must have
											\begin{equation} \lambda_j^M=1 \qquad\qquad(7.47)\end{equation}
											This means that
											\begin{equation} \lambda_j = e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{a}_j} \qquad\qquad(7.48)\end{equation}
											where <span>`\vec{k}`</span> is one of the usual wave vectors allowed in a periodic system,
											\begin{equation} \vec{k} = \frac{\vec{G}}{M} \qquad\qquad(7.49)\end{equation}

											A function <span>`\rho(\vec{R})`</span> that has the translation symmetry of the lattice satisfies
											\begin{equation} \rho(\vec{R}) = \rho(\vec{R}+\vec{R}_{\vec{n}}) \qquad\qquad(3.21)\end{equation}
										
											where <span>`\vec{R}_{\vec{n}}`</span> is a lattice vector
											\begin{equation} \vec{R}_{\vec{n}} = n_1\vec{a}_1 + n_2\vec{a}_2 + n_3\vec{a}_3 \qquad\qquad(3.15)\end{equation}
											
											One way to construct such a periodic function is
											\begin{equation} \rho(\vec{R}) = \sum_{\{\vec{G}\}} \widetilde{\rho}_{\vec{G}} e^{i\vec{G}\cdot\vec{R}} \qquad\qquad(3.23)\end{equation}
											where the set of wave vectors <span>`\{\vec{G}\}`</span>  is determined from the periodicity condition (3.21)
											\begin{equation} e^{ i\vec{G}\cdot(\vec{R}_\vec{n}) } = e^{ i\vec{G}\cdot(n_1\vec{a}_1 + n_2\vec{a}_2 + n_3\vec{a}_3) } = 1 \qquad\qquad(3.24)\end{equation}
											which means
											\begin{equation} \vec{G}\cdot\vec{a}_j = 2\pi m_j,\qquad j=1,2,3 \qquad\qquad(3.25)\end{equation}
											

											It follows that the most general solution of the periodic Schrödinger equation is
											\begin{equation} \psi_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r}) = e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}}u_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r}) \qquad\qquad(7.50)\end{equation}
											where
											\begin{equation} u_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r}+\vec{a}_{j}) = u_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r}),\qquad j=1,2,3 \qquad\qquad(7.51)\end{equation}
											It is straightforward to see that Eq. (7.50) is the most general form consistent with Eqs. (7.45) and (7.48). This is known as <b>Bloch’s theorem</b>.

											<br/>
											For the more general case, we can draw on our experience from Eq.(3.23)
											\begin{equation} u_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r}) = \sum_{\{\vec{G}\}}a_{\vec{G}}(\vec{k})e^{i\vec{G}\cdot\vec{r}} \qquad\qquad(7.54)\end{equation}
											\begin{equation} \psi_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r}) = \sum_{\{\vec{G}\}}a_{\vec{G}}(\vec{k})e^{i(\vec{k}+\vec{G})\cdot\vec{r}} \qquad\qquad(7.55)\end{equation}
											we can restrict the wave vector <span>`\vec{k}`</span> to the first Brillouin zone.
											\begin{equation}\psi_{\vec{k}}(\vec{r}) = \sum_{\{\vec{G}\}} b_{\vec{G}}(\vec{k})e^{i(\vec{k}+\vec{G}'+\vec{G})\cdot\vec{r}}\end{equation}
											We can always choose <span>`\vec{G}'`</span> so that <span>`\vec{k}'`</span> lies in the first Brillouin zone. Thus we can always write the wave functions in the form
											\begin{equation} \psi_{n\vec{k}'}(\vec{r}) = e^{i\vec{k}'\cdot\vec{r}}u_{n\vec{k}'}(\vec{r}) \qquad\qquad(7.58)\end{equation}
											where <span>`\vec{k}'`</span> is restricted to the first Brillouin zone, and use the integer label n, known as the band index, to make up for this restriction.
										
											From Eq.(7.58)
											\begin{equation} \vec{p}\psi_{n\vec{k}} = e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}}(\vec{p}+\hbar\vec{k})u_{n\vec{k}} \qquad\qquad(7.63)\end{equation}
											the Schrodinger equation can be rewritten as
											\begin{equation} \left[ \frac{1}{2m}(\vec{p}+\hbar\vec{k})^2 + V(\vec{r}) \right]u_{n\vec{k}}(\vec{r}) = \epsilon_{n\vec{k}}u_{n\vec{k}}(\vec{r}) \qquad\qquad(7.64)\end{equation}
											
											Now notice that the equation need only be solved within a single unit cell because of the periodicity of <span>`u_{n\vec{k}}'`</span>
											
											1D empty-lattice example
											\begin{equation} \frac{1}{2m} (p+\hbar k)^2  u_{nk}(x) = \epsilon_{nk}u_{nk}(x) \qquad\qquad(7.66)\end{equation}
											with periodic boundary condition
											\begin{equation}  u_{nk}\left( -\frac{a}{2} \right) = u_{nk}\left( +\frac{a}{2} \right);\quad u'_{nk}\left( -\frac{a}{2} \right) = u'_{nk}\left( +\frac{a}{2} \right) \qquad\qquad(7.67)\end{equation}
											the solution is
											\begin{equation}  u_{nk}(x) = \sqrt(\frac{1}{a})e^{-inG_1 sgn(k)x} \qquad\qquad(7.68)\end{equation}
											

											Consider the case of a weak periodic potential of the form
											\begin{equation}  \frac{1}{2m}(p+\hbar k + V(x))^2 u_{nk}(x) = \epsilon_{nk}u_{nk}(x) \qquad\qquad(7.66)\end{equation}
											\begin{equation}  V(x) = vcos(G_1x) = \frac{v}{2}(e^{i2\pi x/a}+e^{-i 2\pi x/a}) \qquad\qquad(7.69)\end{equation}
											where <span>`G_1 = \frac{2\pi}{a}`</span>

										<h1>Why Disorder and Localization Are Important
									</header>
									Paradoxically, the extreme universality of the transport properties in the quantum Hall regime occurs because of, rather than in spite of, the random disorder and uncontrolled imperfections which the devices contain. Anderson localization in the presence of disorder plays an essential role in the quantization, but this localization is strongly modified from the usual case because of the strong magnetic field.
									<br />
									<body>
										<br />
										In our study of Anderson localization we found that in 2D all states are localized even for arbi- trarily weak disorder. The essence of this weak localization effect was shown to be the logarithmic divergence of the time integral of the current “echo” associated with the quantum interference corrections to classical transport. We further saw that these quantum interference effects relied crucially on the existence of time-reversal symmetry. 
										<div class = "formula">
											Thus the aspect ratio <span>`L \/ W`</span> (or any other geometric parameter) does not enter the relation between <span>`R_{yx}`</span> and <span>`\rho_{yx}`</span>. This is crucial to the universality of the result. In particular, it means that one does not have to measure the physical dimensions of the sample to one part in <span>`10^{10}`</span> in order to obtain the Hall resistivity to that precision. 			
										</div>
										<br />
										Therefore, there is no need to distinguish between the Hall resistance and the Hall resistivity.
										<hr />
										<div class = "formula">
											In the absence of any impurities, the 2D electron gas is translationally invariant and there does not exist any preferred frame of reference.
											As a result, we can transform to a frame of reference moving with velocity <span>`-\vec{v}`</span> relative to the lab frame. In this frame the electrons appear to be moving at velocity <span>`+\vec{v}`</span> and carrying current density

											\begin{equation}\begin{matrix}\frac{\vec{E}'}{c} = \gamma(\frac{\vec{E}}{c}+\vec{\beta}\times\vec{B}) - \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma+1}\vec{\beta}(\vec{\beta}\cdot\frac{\vec{E}}{c})\\  \vec{B}' = \gamma(\vec{B}-\vec{\beta}\times\frac{\vec{E}}{c}) - \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma+1}\vec{\beta}(\vec{\beta}\cdot\vec{B}) \end{matrix} \qquad\qquad(12)\end{equation}
										</div>
										
										<div class = "formula">
											In which, <span>`\vec{\beta} = \frac{(-\vec{v})}{c}`</span> and <span>`\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2}}`</span>. Since <span>`\beta`</span> is small，in moving frame, the electromagnetic fields are (to the lowest order in <span>`\beta`</span>)

									These harmonic oscillator levels are called <b>Landau levels</b>.

									We assume periodic boundary conditions in the y direction. Because of the vector potential, it is impossible to simultaneously have periodic boundary conditions in the x direction.

										Having now found the eigenfunctions for an electron in a strong magnetic field, we can relate them back to the semiclassical picture of wave packets undergoing circular cyclotron motion.

										In the semiclassical limit, we have
										\begin{equation}\left(n+\frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_c \sim \frac{\hbar^2 K^2}{2m_e}\qquad\qquad(39)\end{equation}

									<div class = "formula">
										We see from the integrand that the current density is anti-symmetric about the peak of the Gaussian at <span>`X_k = kl^2`</span> and hence the total current vanishes. This anti-symmetry is the remnant of the semiclassical circular motion.
										This could perhaps be anticipated from the observation that the energy of the Landau-level states is independent of the wave vector k, thus the group velocity is given by

										<h1>Integer Quantum Hall Effect Edge State

									Now that we understand drift in a uniform electric field, we can consider the problem of electrons confined in a Hall bar of finite width by a non-uniform electric field. 
									For simplicity, we will consider the situation where the potential V(x) is smooth on the scale of the magnetic length.
					
									We see that the group velocity
									<div class = "formula">
										\begin{equation} \vec{v}_k = \frac{1}{\hbar}\frac{\partial\epsilon_{kn}}{\partial k}\hat{y} \approx \frac{el^2}{\hbar}\left.\frac{d V(x)}{dx}\right|_{x = X_k}\hat{y}\qquad\qquad(56)\end{equation}
									</div>
									<h5> Landau-level dispersions in the presence of a confining potential, for a sample with Hall bar geometry </h5>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/ek.png" alt="" /></span>
									This means that in the ground state there are edge currents of opposite sign flowing in the sample. The semiclassical interpretation of these currents is that they represent “skipping orbits” in which the circular cyclotron motion is interrupted by collisions with the walls at the edges.
									<br />
									<br />
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/edgestate.png" alt="" /></span>
									
									
									Because momentum in a magnetic field corresponds to position, the edges are essentially real-space realizations of the Fermi surface.
									A Hall voltage drop across the sample in the x direction corresponds to a difference in electrochemical potential between the two edges.
									This has the effect of increasing the number of electrons in skipping orbits on one edge of the sample and/or decreasing the number on the other edge.
									To calculate this current we have to add up the group velocities of all the occupied states,
									<div class = "formula">
										\begin{equation} 
										I = -\frac{e}{L_y}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} dk \frac{L_y}{2\pi\hbar}\frac{\partial \epsilon_k}{\partial k}n_k
										\qquad\qquad(57)\end{equation}
									</div>
									<div class = "formula">
										You are certainly puzzled about why there is not a '2' coeficient here, because there are two electrons in a state.
										Noticing that the electrons are in a strong B field, so we should consider Zeeman splitting, which cause the a state split into two states.
										Therefore, the states with <span>`\epsilon_k`</span> energy are actually two states with a little different energy around <span>`\epsilon_k`</span>. And we regard them as two different states, so there isn't a '2' coefficient in the Eq. (57).

									</div>
									
									where for the moment we assume that, in the bulk, only a single Landau level is occupied and n<sub>k</sub> is the probability that state k in that Landau level is occupied. Assuming zero temperature and noting that the integrand is a perfect derivative, we have
									<div class = "formula">
										\begin{equation} 
										I = -\frac{e}{h}\int_{\mu_R}^{\mu_L} d\epsilon = -\frac{e}{h}[\mu_R-\mu_L]
										\qquad\qquad(58)\end{equation}

										\begin{equation} 
										(-e)V_H = (-e)[V_R-V_L] = [\mu_R-\mu_L]

										\begin{equation} 
										I = \nu \frac{e^2}{h}V_H

									<div class = "formula">
										where we have now allowed for the possibility that <span>`\nu`</span> different Landau levels are occupied in the bulk and hence there are ν separate edge channels contributing to the current.

									we have the desired results
									<div class = "formula">
										\begin{equation} \begin{aligned}
										&\sigma_{xx} = 0\\
										&\sigma_{xy} = \nu\frac{e^2}{h}
										\end{aligned}\qquad\qquad(61)\end{equation}

									<hr />
									So far we have been ignoring the possible effects of disorder. 
									Remarkably, in the QHE case, the backscat- tering is essentially zero in very wide samples. 
									In the case of the Hall bar, scattering into a backward-moving state would require transfer of the electron from one edge of the sample to the other, since the edge states are spatially separated.
									In short, there can be nothing but forward scattering.
									An incoming wave given by Eq.(62)
